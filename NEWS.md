# Mhorseshoe 0.1.3

* Edit vignette and descriptions

# Mhorseshoe 0.1.2

This is a very small release focused on fixing issues seen in 
approx_horseshoe's examples in 0.1.0 and the submitted 0.1.1 version.

* Fix a problem that occurred in the examples of approx_horseshoe. This 
problem occurs when the size of the data is not large enough and the threshold 
argument is set too large when auto.threshold=FALSE.

* Add code to the approx_horseshoe function: If a problem occurs because the 
threshold argument is set too large, a warning is output and the result is 
returned.

# Mhorseshoe 0.1.1

* Fixed bug in examples of approx_horseshoe

# Mhorseshoe 0.1.0
