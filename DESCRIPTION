Description: The horseshoe estimator is an algorithm frequently used in
    high-dimensional Bayesian linear models. Although this algorithm has a good
    effect on variable selection, it incurs high computational costs in
    high-dimensional sparse data where p >> N for p predictors and N
    observations. Therefore, an exact horseshoe estimator algorithm function
    and an approximate algorithm function that can compensate for the
    computational cost problem were added to enable use in high-dimensional
    Bayesian linear regression.
