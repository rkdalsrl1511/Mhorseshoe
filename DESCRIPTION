Description: Mhorseshoe is a package for a high-dimensional Bayesian linear 
    modeling algorithm using a horseshoe prior. This package provides three 
    different algorithm functions. exact_horseshoe, approx_horseshoe, 
    mapprox_horseshoe. approx_horseshoe and mapprox_horseshoe are versions 
    that can lower the computational cost than the existing horseshoe 
    estimator through the approximate MCMC algorithm in the case of p >> N 
    for p predictors and N observations.
