Description: Provides an approximate algorithm for the horseshoe estimator
    used in Bayesian linear models. By implementing a sampler with high
    computational cost in the 'Rcpp' package and using an approximate algorithm
    that reduces matrix calculation complexity, parameter estimation speed for
    high-dimensional sparse data is faster. The approximate algorithm is
    described in Johndrow et al. (2020)
